Some questions that came to my mind when I was reading the paper

- [How do bottleneck architectures work in neural networks?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/205150/how-do-bottleneck-architectures-work-in-neural-networks)
- [What does dotted line mean in ResNet?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/457787/what-does-dotted-line-mean-in-resnet) `refering to Figure 3, 34-layer residual from paper`
